    "text": "Regression is a way to find a relationship between variables and use that relationship to make predictions.\nFor example:\n\nIf you know the size of a house, regression can help predict its price.\nIf you know a student‚Äôs study hours, regression can estimate their exam score.\n\nIt‚Äôs like drawing a trend line through data points to see how one thing changes with another. üìàüòä\nLinear regression is one of the most useful and popular forecasting tools available. Quite simply, it assumes that there is a linear relationship between one variable and a second variable. If you plot data for these two variables on a graph, you can draw a line through it and make a decent guess about what the second variable will be depending on the value of the first variable.\nTo learn more technical aspects of linear regression, visit the Wikipedia entry.\n\n# Load dataset\ndata(iris)\n\n# Fit linear regression model\nmodel &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\n\n# Display a visualization that helps explain the model\n# Load necessary library\ninstall.packages('ggplot2')\n\n# Downloading packages -------------------------------------------------------\n- Downloading ggplot2 from CRAN ...

The variable Sepal Length is on the y-axis (vertical) and is called the ‚Äúdependent‚Äù variable. As you might guess, the objective of this ‚Äúmodel‚Äù (a simulation of reality) is to see how much influence Petal Length may have on Sepal Length. We don‚Äôt know if they are related at all at first, but by examining the data we can tease out that perhaps we can draw a straight line through the data that explains a possible relationship. In this case we see that, generally speaking, the longer the petal length is on an iris, the longer sepal length will be. Sometimes these relationships are intuitive, such as a taller person being heavier than a short person, but not always. Generally, we use data science to look for non-obvious relationships and performing a linear regression is just one tool.\nNow that we have an intuitive grasp on the subject from the visualization, let‚Äôs look at the statistical facts about this model.\n\n# Display model summary\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.24675 -0.29657 -0.01515  0.27676  1.00269 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
