Classification models are used when you know the categories, or labels, that you wish to use on your data. Both classification and regression are forms of **supervised** learning.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from a labeled data setâ€”that is, data that has both **input features (X)** and known **target outputs (Y)**. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs so it can make predictions on new, unseen data.

A practical example of supervised learning and classification is spam email detection. We want to automatically classify incoming emails as **"spam"** or **"not spam."** The **inputs (features) c**ould include:

-    Presence of certain keywords (like "free", "winner", etc.)

-   Sender's email address

-   Number of links or attachments

-   Email length

-   Frequency of punctuation like "!!!" or "\$\$\$"

These act like clues to let the computer know that a specific email could be spam. You can understand how this is modeled on human thinking. We also look for patterns that will lead us to a conclusion.

The **outputs (labels) :**

-   

-   

    `1` for spam

-   

-   

    `0` for not spam (aka ham)
