Classification models are used when you know the categories, or labels, that you wish to use on your data. Both classification and regression are forms of **supervised** learning.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from a labeled data setâ€”that is, data that has both **input features (X)** and known **target outputs (Y)**. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs so it can make predictions on new, unseen data.

A practical example of supervised learning and classification is spam email detection. We want to automatically classify incoming emails as **"spam"** or **"not spam."** The **inputs (features) c**ould include:

-   Presence of certain keywords (like "free", "winner", etc.)

-   Sender's email address

-   Number of links or attachments

-   Email length

-   Frequency of punctuation like "!!!" or "\$\$\$"

These act like clues to let the computer know that a specific email could be spam. You can understand how this is modeled on human thinking. We also look for patterns that will lead us to a conclusion.

The **outputs (labels)** in this case would be `1` for spam, and `0` for not spam (aka ham). If you have email a classification model is likely at work on your account, separating the "spam" from the "ham."

Common supervised learning models used for classifying data are:

**Logistic Regression**

This is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It estimates the probability that the dependent variable equals a certain value (usually 1), using a logistic function (sigmoid curve).

**Naive Bayes**

Support Vector Machines

Random Forests

Neural Networks
