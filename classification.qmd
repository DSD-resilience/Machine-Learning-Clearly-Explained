Classification models are used when you know the categories, or labels, that you wish to use on your data. Both classification and regression are forms of **supervised** learning.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from a labeled datasetâ€”that is, data that has both **input features (X)** and known **target outputs (Y)**. The goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs so it can make predictions on new, unseen data.
