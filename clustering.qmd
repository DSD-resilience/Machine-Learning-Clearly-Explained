Clustering is used when you want to classify your data but you are not sure how. Clustering is a form of **unsupervised** learning.

One type of popular clustering model is **K-means** clustering.

**Assumes**: Spherical clusters of equal variance.

**Strengths**: Fast, simple, works well with large datasets.

**Limitations**: Requires the number of clusters (`k`) to be specified; not great with non-spherical or varying-density clusters.

R package: \[`stats::kmeans()`\], also `cluster` and `factoextra` for visualization.

Another popular type of clustering model is **Hierarchical** clustering.

**Types**: Agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down).

**Output**: Dendrogram (tree of clusters).

**Strengths**: Does not require predefined `k`; good for nested structures.

**Limitations**: Computationally expensive for large datasets.

R package: `stats::hclust()`, `dendextend`, `cluster`.
